case1

Hi. I am trying to get my test cases to show up on CircleCI but it is not working. I have a fork of this project
in my github account https://github.com/mtedone/podam. I added the project to CircleCI and got a green
build but the Test Results tab is empty



Hello Harry,

I forked the project also and built it and indeed, the test results tab is empty.
Can you please check this link:
https://circleci.com/docs/1.0/test-metadata/#java-junit-results-with-maven-surefire-plugin

You should be able to fix this issue now, following this steps.
Please let me know if you need more help.

Thank you,

Mihaela Ion







case 2 

Hi. I added my project to CircleCI but I can’t get the build complete. I’m not sure what I’m doing wrong.
Can you help? My project is https://github.com/nym2015/commons-csv. 


Hello Jolene,

Please be informed that I forked the repository and added it to CircleCI and I was able to build it.
The built was successful.
Can you please check again?

Thank you,

Mihaela Ion




case 3 

Dear customer support,
I need to explain how CircleCI works to my boss. I’ve read the docs but I still don’t get it. Can you please
explain to me, in your own words, how CircleCI works? Also, it seems like you don’t support .NET builds.
Why is that?


Dear Adam,

The CI stands for Continuous Integration. 
It is a development practice used by software developers that, in general terms, ensure that developers are all on the same page.

Thank you,

Mihaela Ion
